            <h2>About Me </h2>

        
        <p> I have always had a passion for development and design. <br>

            <br>

            <strong>2007</strong> - It all started studying a National diploma in Graphic design, <br>
            which included basic web development.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            <strong>2009</strong> - I took a job working as a Graphic Designer with a local print <br> company. I 
            was the only designer and worked across a <br> variety of projects over six years.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>2015</strong> - I started working at AO.com doing something completley <br> different to design. As
            much as I enjoyed my time doing design, <br> I just wanted to learn more and learn to <br> build
            apps/websites from scratch.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            <strong>2019 </strong> - Four years after working at AO.com I have now become an <br> Apprentice Junior Developer. 
            I am currently studying at <br> Code Nation in Manchester and the course lasts 12 weeks. <br> I will then
            return to AO.com as a Junior Developer. </p>
