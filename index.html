        <h2>About Me</h2>

        
    <p> I have always had a passion for development and design. <br> <br>

        <strong>2007</strong> - It all started studying a National diploma in Graphic design, which included basic web development.

        <br>
        <br>
            
        <strong>2009</strong> - I took a job working as a Graphic Designer with a local print company. I was the only designer and worked across a variety of projects over six years.

        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>2015</strong> - I started working at AO.com doing something completley different to design. As
        much as I enjoyed my time doing design, I just wanted to learn more and learn to build
        apps/websites from scratch.
      
        <br>
        <br>

        <strong>2019 </strong> - Four years after working at AO.com I have now become an Apprentice Junior Developer. I am currently studying at Code Nation in Manchester and the course lasts 12 weeks. I will then
        return to AO.com as a Junior Developer. </p>
